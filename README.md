# TestNG
In this script I verify if test if the homepage of jedox.com works and signup button is present

Please make sure that you change the path where my chromedriver.exe is located in the setUp() function.

For example 

	public void setUp() {		
	System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "location of your chromedriver");
}
